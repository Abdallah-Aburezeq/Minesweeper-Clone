# Minesweeper-Clone

This repository features a minesweeper clone created in Visual Basic titled "Operation Mine".

The game randomly sets 10 mines in a grid of 81 tiles. The player must then flag all 10 tiles by right-clicking on tiles to win the game,  aided by the context of numbers signifying nearby mines.
